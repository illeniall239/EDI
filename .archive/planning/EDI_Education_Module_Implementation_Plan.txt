EDI.AI LEARN MODE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Add a simple "Learn Mode" toggle to EDI.ai that provides guided spreadsheet learning through AI tutoring and synthetic datasets. This feature enhances user engagement and skills development within the existing productivity platform, creating a seamless learning experience without complex certification systems.

Core Concept: Work Mode ↔ Learn Mode toggle buttons in navigation bar
Learning Approach: Topic selection → Synthetic dataset generation → AI-guided step-by-step instruction
Value Proposition: Learn spreadsheet skills in the same interface you'll use for real work

===============================================================================

1. LEARN MODE FRAMEWORK

LEARN MODE PHILOSOPHY
"Choose What You Want to Learn Today" - Simple topic selection leads to hands-on practice with AI guidance in the same spreadsheet interface users will use for real work.

LEARNING TOPIC MENU

- Creating charts and visualizations
- Pivot tables for data summary
- Data filtering and sorting
- Basic formulas (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, IF)
- Data cleaning and formatting
- Statistical analysis basics
- Survey data quality control (your specialty)

HOW LEARN MODE WORKS

1. Mode Toggle: Work Mode ↔ Learn Mode buttons in navigation bar
2. Topic Selection: "What would you like to learn today?" menu
3. Synthetic Data Generation: AI creates relevant practice dataset
4. Guided Instruction: Step-by-step AI tutoring through real examples
5. Session Persistence: "Continue where you left off" functionality
6. Seamless Transition: Toggle back to Work Mode with new skills

SESSION MANAGEMENT
