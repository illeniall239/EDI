YOUR PERSONAL PAIN POINT (Compelling Origin Story):
"As a quality analyst working with survey data, I spent hours manually checking for:
- Pattern detection in open-ended responses
- Interviewer manipulation or data fabrication
- Inconsistent response patterns across interviews
- Junk or unrelated responses in text fields

This work that should take minutes was taking hours. VLOOKUP still takes me 2-3 tries to get right. New team members see these complex formulas and run away. We've been following the same rigid manual processes for decades."

5. INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & RESPONSES

OPENING QUESTIONS

"Tell us about your startup"
RESPONSE: "EDI.ai eliminates the manual data work that consumes 40% of analysts' time. As a quality analyst, I personally spent hours manually checking survey responses for patterns and inconsistencies - work that should take minutes with AI. We've built an AI-powered spreadsheet that maintains Excel's familiar interface while adding intelligent automation. Users can upload data, get instant analysis through natural language, and generate comprehensive reports - all without learning new tools or abandoning existing workflows."

"What problem are you solving?"
RESPONSE: "1.1 billion Excel users struggle with manual, repetitive data tasks. In survey research specifically, quality analysts spend hours manually checking for response patterns, data fabrication, and inconsistencies. Our platform automates these quality control processes while providing accessible AI-powered analysis through familiar spreadsheet interfaces. We're saving both micro-minutes on individual tasks and macro-minutes on entire workflows."

MARKET & OPPORTUNITY QUESTIONS

"How big is this market?"
RESPONSE: "The global spreadsheet market is $10.6 billion growing to $19.6 billion by 2034. But we're not just competing for existing users - we're expanding the market to people who currently avoid spreadsheets due to complexity. With 1.1 billion Excel users and the AI analytics market growing at 29% CAGR to $236 billion, we're positioned at the intersection of familiar tools and exponential AI adoption."

"Who are your customers?"
RESPONSE: "Primary: Quality analysts and survey researchers who manually check data integrity (my background)
Secondary: Data analysts who spend 60% of their time on data wrangling
Tertiary: Business users who struggle with Excel formulas but need data insights
Our beachhead is quality control professionals because I understand their specific workflows, then we expand to adjacent roles in data analysis."

"What's your business model?"
SUGGESTED TIERS:
- Free: Basic analysis, 3 datasets
- Professional ($29/month): Unlimited datasets, advanced AI features, export capabilities
- Enterprise ($99/user/month): Team collaboration, API access, custom integrations, priority support

COMPETITIVE QUESTIONS

"Why wouldn't people just use ChatGPT for data analysis?"
RESPONSE: "ChatGPT requires constant context switching - export data, lose workflow state, re-explain context every session. EDI.ai maintains persistent data state with continuous conversation memory. Plus, we're specialized for data integrity with built-in quality controls, automated anomaly detection, and spreadsheet functionality that ChatGPT can't provide."

"Microsoft will build this into Excel"
RESPONSE: "They will eventually, but they move slowly to avoid breaking workflows for 1.1 billion users. We can iterate rapidly and serve users who need this now. When they do add AI, we'll have refined the experience and can focus on specialized use cases like survey quality control that they won't prioritize."

"How do you compete with Airtable/Notion?"
RESPONSE: "They require learning new interfaces and abandoning existing workflows. We provide immediate value to Excel users without migration friction. Our focus is data analysis automation, not project management - different use case, different user journey."

TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

"How does your AI actually work?"
RESPONSE: "We use LangChain agents specialized for different tasks - SQL query generation, data visualization, quality control checks. Google Gemini 2.0 Flash processes natural language queries, our agents execute database operations and generate visualizations. Everything runs on temporary SQLite databases created from uploaded files, maintaining data privacy while enabling complex analysis."

"What about AI accuracy and hallucinations?"
RESPONSE: "Data integrity is core to our value proposition. We show confidence levels for AI suggestions, maintain audit trails of all operations, and allow users to verify before execution. The AI assists and accelerates human judgment rather than replacing it. For survey quality control, we flag anomalies for human review rather than making automatic decisions."

TRACTION & VALIDATION QUESTIONS

"What's your traction?"
PREPARE SPECIFIC METRICS:
- User sign-ups and monthly active users
- Average time saved per user per week
- Customer feedback and testimonials
- Revenue metrics if available
- Usage statistics (queries processed, reports generated)

"How do you acquire customers?"
RESPONSE: "Word-of-mouth in the data analyst community. These professionals share solutions to painful problems. I'm starting with quality analysts and survey researchers through industry forums, LinkedIn groups, and conferences. The 'save 10 hours per week' value proposition sells itself once demonstrated."

OBJECTION HANDLING

"How do you retain users long-term?"
RESPONSE: "Once someone automates tasks that previously took hours, reverting becomes impossible. We're building habit-forming workflows that become essential to job functions. Our conversation memory and persistent data state create switching costs. Plus, continuous AI improvements increase value over time."

"What if your AI makes mistakes?"
RESPONSE: "We're building trust through transparency. All AI operations show confidence levels and allow preview before execution. Users can verify SQL queries before running them. For critical decisions like flagging survey responses, we provide evidence and recommendations rather than automatic actions."

"Isn't this market too crowded?"
RESPONSE: "The market is large enough for multiple winners. Most competitors focus on either advanced users (SQL tools) or simple formula generation. We're uniquely positioned for the massive middle market - Excel users who need more power but don't want complexity. Our quality control specialization creates defensible differentiation."
